	Data Structures - Review
		+ Arrays
		+ Linked-List
			- Single/Double
		+ Graphs
			- Nodes/Edges
			- Directed/Undirected
			Representing Graphs In Code
				- Adjacency List
				- Adjacency Matrix
				List = [(A, B), (B, C)]
				
				Adjacency Matrix		O(1) to check connections
					A	B	C
				A	1	1	0
				B	0	1	1
				C	0	0	1
				
				Traversing a Graph
					Walk
						Any Route
					Path
						A Route With No Repeating Nodes
					Trail
						A Route With Out Repeating Edges
					Cycle
						A Path That Ends And Begins On The Same Node
					Circuit
						A Trail That Ends And Begins On The Same Node
		+ Tree
			- A Graph Without Cycles
			Pre Order
					O      Balanced (Differs By One On Either Side)
				   / \
				  O   O
				 / \ /
				O  O O
				
				-As You Encounter Them
				
				BFS : Local Order
					Searches The First Level First, Then The Second Level.
				
				EX:
					1, 2, 3, 4, 5
						1
						 \
						  2
						   \
						    3
							 \
							  4
							   \
							    5
								
				EX:
							Tree			Level
						2^0 = 1		O		0
						    	   / \		
						2^1 = 2   O   O     1
								 / \ / \
						2^2 = 4 O  O O  O 	2
						
						Height Of Just The Root Is 0
						
						Number Of Nodes = |N|
						Height = floor(lg(|N|))
						
						
	Algorithmic Problem Solving (Cornom)
		- Understand The Problem
		- Decide On:
			Computational Means
			Exact/Approximate Solution?
			Data Structure
				How Long It Takes / How Much Memory It Uses
			Design Technique
		- Design The Algorithm
		- Prove Correctness
		- Analyze The Algorithm
		- Code It
		Problem Types
			Sort
				* Best Worst Case is O(nlgn)
			Searching
			String Processing
			************Graph Problems
			Geometric Problems
			Numerical Problems
		Asymptotic Notation
			Worst Case
				Guarenteed It Will Do No Worse Than O()
				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation
				See Onenote
			
		
	Compare Orders Of Growth
		Use Limits
			L'Hopitals Rule
		Stirling's Formula
			n! (aprox) = rad(2 * pi * n) (n / e)^n
	
	Analysis Of Non-Recursive Algorithm
		1) Find What Determins The Input Size
		2) Identify The Algorithm's Basic Operation
			(Usually In The Inner-Most Loop)
		3) Check If The Basic Operation Depends Only On The Size Of The Input
		4) Set Up Summation To Represent The Number Of Times The Basic Operation Is Executed
		5) Develop A Closed-Form Solution Or Order Of Growth

	Use The Def Of Big O or L'Hopitals Rule

	example
		//Array A and Size n
		FindMax(A, n):
			int max=0;
			for (i = 0; i < n; ++i):
				if (A[i] > max) max = A[i];
			return max;

	void insertionSort(int *a, int n) {
		for (int i = 1; i < Size; ++i) {
			int v = a[i];
			int j = i-1;
			while (i >= 0 && a[i] > v) {
				a[j+i] = a[j];
				j--;
			}
			a[i+1] = v;
		}
	}
	proof
		First, construct the loop invariant
			a condition that holds after each iteration of the loop
		Prove for:
			Initialiization - prior to the first iteration
			Maintanence - After the iteration
			Termination - After the loop terminates

	DFS (Node n)
		DFS(n -> left)
		DFS(n -> right)
		
	DigitCount(n)
		if (n==0) return 1;
		if (n==1) return 1;
		return DigitCount(n / 2) + 1;
		
		
	A(0) = 0;
	A(1) = 1;
	A(n) = A(n/2) + 1;
		A(n/2) = A(n/2/2) + 1 = A(n/4) + 1;
			A(n/4) = A(n/4/2) + 1 = A(n/8) + 1;
		A(n/2) = A(n/8) + 1 + 1;
	A(n) = A(n/8) + 1 + 1 + 1 = A(n/8) + 3;
	A(n) = A(n/(2^i)) + i;
	A(n) = A(n/(2^(log 2 n))) + log 2 n = lg(n)
	lg(n) <= c lg(n)
	in O(lg(n))
	
	iter (int a, int n)
		if (n == 0) return 1
		if (n==1) return a
		for (i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
			a *= a;

		return 1;
		
	rec(a, n)
		if (n == 0) return 1

	m(0) = 0
	m(1) = 0
	m(n) = m(n/2) + 1

		if (n == 1) return a;
		if (n %2)
			return (rec(a,(n-1)/2)**2) * A
		else
			return (rec(a,n/2)**2)
			
	HINT
		Calls itself recurive
			divides by a number
			almost always has a log
			ex : T(n) = T(n/b)

	Minimal Spanning Tree
		Find spanning tree that minimize the sum of edges
				^(Includes all nodes from graph)
		Prim's Algorithm
			-Greedy Algorithm
		Kruskal's Algorithm
			-Greedy
			-Must Detect if new edge will create a cycle
		Cycle Detection
			Use DFS/BFS
			1. Select a random node
			2. Preform DFS/BFS from node
			3. If the current node has been visited before then there is a cycle.
